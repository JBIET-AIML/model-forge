# MODEL FORGE 2026

**Innovate • Build • Deploy**

Model Forge 2026 is a premier machine learning hackathon hosted by the **Department of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** and **CSE (AI&ML)** at **JB Institute of Engineering & Technology (JBIET)**. This event challenges students to design algorithms from scratch and build independent models to solve real-world problems.

## 📅 Event Details

- **Date:** 25 February 2026
- **Time:** 09:30 AM
- **Venue:** JBIET Main Block
- **Team Size:** 3-4 Members
- **Registration Fee:** ₹100 per head

## 🏆 Competition Tracks (Models)

### 01. Natural Language Processing (AI vs Human)
Build models that distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text.
- **Goal:** Classify text samples accurately.
- **Focus:** Academic integrity, content moderation, and AI safety.

### 02. Time Series & Forecasting (MacroQuant)
Predict future trends using historical data.
- **Use Cases:** Stock prices, weather forecasting, and demand prediction.

### 03. Computer Vision (Classroom Monitoring)
Enable machines to interpret visual information.
- **Tasks:** Image classification, object detection, and behavioral analysis.

### 04. Generative AI
Create new content using advanced AI techniques.
- **Models:** GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models for text, image, and music generation.

## 🎁 Prizes

- 🥇 **Winner:** Cash Prize + Certificate + Goodies
- 🥈 **1st Runner Up:** Certificate + Goodies

## 📝 Rules & Guidelines

- **Reproducibility:** Models must be reproducible with documented preprocessing steps.
- **Data Integrity:** No future data usage or leakage; use of proprietary datasets is prohibited.
- **Pretrained Models:** External pretrained models are allowed but must be disclosed.
- **Deliverables:** Trained model weights, inference code, test set predictions, and a methodology report.
